                was born out of the deeply rooted experiences of its 
                founders, who spent years working in some of the most
                 disaster-prone and poverty-stricken areas of Uganda,
                  including the Karamoja region and various refugee 
                  settlements. <br><br>In these environments, the founders 
                  witnessed firsthand the struggles of vulnerable
                   communities. These challenges inspired a deep 
                   commitment to extending their expertise beyond 
                   immediate disaster relief but also realising the 
                   concern for the long-term needs of people living in 
                   such dire conditions. ACRI recognized that while 
                   emergency aid provides essential short-term relief,
                    the path to recovery requires sustained and 
                    holistic support with inclusion. <br><br>
                ACRI is focused on the person as a whole by 
                providing inclusive resilience support. By using an
                 integrated approach, ACRI forms partnerships with 
                 individuals and existing organizations throughout 
                 the world, allowing us to create effective models 
                 and sustainable solutions that can be applied globally
                 , we get started out as a promise to a small village 
                 in a devastated area with hope of growing quickly into
                  an international network that looks at <strong>“Empowering
                   for self-reliance” </strong>around the world. ACRI has a team
                    that is composed of people wanting to contribute
                     their skills, time, knowledge, and their passion 
                     to support people in need.
